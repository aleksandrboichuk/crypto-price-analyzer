### Task

Develop a mechanism for price analysis on the following crypto exchanges:

- binance.com
- jbex.com
- poloniex.com
- bybit.com
- whitebit.com

It is necessary:
- find the necessary API endpoints for obtaining current prices between possible currency pairs for all the above-mentioned exchanges;

- currency pairs must match on all the above-mentioned crypto exchanges (if a currency pair is not available on one of the exchanges - this currency pair must be omitted and not analyzed);

- develop a console command to obtain the lowest and highest price between the currency pair selected by the user, and show on which exchange this rate (for example - BTC/USDT, display the rate and name of the exchange);
